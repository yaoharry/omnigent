"""Server-side WebSocket endpoint for runner tunnels (Phase 4/10).

Runners behind NAT connect here via outbound WebSocket. The server
pushes framed HTTP requests over the tunnel; the runner's ASGI
adapter dispatches them and frames responses back.

Per ``designs/RUNNER.md`` §2, the runner sends a ``hello`` frame
on connect advertising its version, harness capabilities, and env
types. The server validates ``frame_protocol_version`` for version-
skew enforcement (strict-major, loose-minor per §2 "Version skew").

The endpoint registers the runner in the :class:`TunnelRegistry`
which the :class:`WSTunnelTransport` uses to route requests.
