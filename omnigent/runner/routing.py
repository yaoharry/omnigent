"""Conversation-aware runner routing for the Omnigent server.

The tunnel registry is the source of truth for online runners. This
module turns that registry into the one dispatch decision the server
needs: given a conversation and harness kind, read the bound runner and
return an ``httpx`` client that talks to that runner over the WebSocket
tunnel.
