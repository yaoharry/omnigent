"""Harness readiness checks used by the host daemon.

The daemon reports a per-harness readiness map in its hello frame, refreshes
it while connected (so the web agent picker can warn accurately), and
re-checks the session's harness before spawning a runner (so an unconfigured
launch fails clearly instead of dying inside the executor).

"Configured" here is deliberately narrow: the **only** thing the daemon
can reliably determine locally is whether a harness's wrapped CLI binary
is on ``PATH``. That gates the native CLI harnesses (Claude Code / Codex
via ``claude`` / ``codex``) and ``pi`` — the common "I picked Claude Code
but never ran ``omnigent setup`` to install it" case.

In-process SDK harnesses (``claude-sdk``, ``openai-agents``,
``antigravity``) run without any CLI and resolve their model credentials
at runtime. The **launch gate** still never blocks them: the spec's
``executor.auth`` (with ``${ENV}`` expansion) is invisible here, so a
hard gate would break launches that actually work. The **picker map**,
however, checks the credential sources the daemon *can* see locally —
locally resolvable provider entries (including ambient-detected local
providers such as a reachable Ollama), ambient env API keys, Claude Code's
own login / managed settings, an ambient Databricks workspace — and reports
``"needs-auth"`` when none is visible, so a credential-less host warns
before the first turn dies instead of after. Unknown harnesses fail
open on both axes.

    Only CLI-wrapping harnesses are assessed (native Claude/Codex/Kiro and
    ``pi`` / ``pi-native``): they cannot run without their binary on
    ``PATH``, and that is the one thing the daemon can check reliably and
    locally. SDK harnesses and unknown harnesses always return ``True`` —
    spec-level credentials are invisible here, so blocking them would risk
    false negatives that break working launches. (The picker map separately
    reports ``"needs-auth"`` for an SDK harness with no locally visible
    credential — see :func:`_sdk_harness_availability` — but that signal
    warns, it never gates a launch.)

    The check is binary-only: an installed-but-not-logged-in CLI still
    returns ``True`` because auth failures surface at run time rather than
    blocking dispatch.

    :param harness: A harness id, e.g. ``"claude-native"``, ``"codex"``,
        ``"openai-agents"``, ``"agents_sdk"``, ``"kiro-native"``, ``"pi"``,
        ``"pi-native"``, ``"qwen"``, or ``"qwen-code"``.
    :returns: ``True`` when launchable (CLI installed, or a harness the
        daemon doesn't gate); ``False`` when the binary is missing or on
        an unsupported version.
